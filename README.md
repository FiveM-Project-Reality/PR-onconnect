#OnConnect
A FiveM Resource that checks the connecting user in the MySQL Database :D

##What does it check?
It checks for:
  -Any bans and the reason, who banned the user, and how much time the user has if any
  -Checks to see if Steam is open
  -Checks player inside of our table for certain information

It also updates the SteamName as they connect incase they changed it previously
